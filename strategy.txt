Detection : 
	rotate 
	Loop:
		read US
		if !exceed ring diameter 
			case 1 : stop rotating and just push
			case 2 : continue rotating for a few millisecs and then stop at the middle
			case 3 : stop rotating, read angle & sick trig -> angle it to face the middle of the enemy's robot

Losing Detection : 
	If lost, stop and go back to Detection() 

Fail-safe plan : 
	Keep moving forward until the robot detects the line 
	Rotate 30 degrees(?) 
	Repeat 
	Run at full speed
